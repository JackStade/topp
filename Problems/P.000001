* Number: 1
* Problem: Minimum Weight Triangulation
* Statement: 
Can a mininimum weight triangulation of a planar point set
be found in polynomial time?
The \emph{weight} of a triangulation is its total edge length.
* Origin: Perhaps E. L. Lloyd, 1977: \cite{l-tspp-77},
cited in Garey and Johnson~\cite{gj-cigtn-79}.
* Status/Conjectures: Just solved by 
Wolfgang Mulzer and G\"unter Rote, January 2006!
\url{http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.CG/0601002}.
Entry to be updated later...

This problem is one
of the few from Garey and Johnson~\cite[p.~288]{gj-cigtn-79} whose
complexity status remains unknown.
* Partial and Related Results:
The best approximation algorithms achieve a (large) constant times
the optimal length~\cite{lk-qgtam-96};
good heuristics are known~\cite{dmm-naefm-95}.
If Steiner points are allowed, again constant-factor
approximations are known~\cite{e-amwst-94,cl-qrsam-98},
but it is open to decide even if a minimum-weight Steiner triangulation
exists (the minimum might be approached only
in the limit).
