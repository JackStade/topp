* Number: 2
* Problem: Voronoi Diagram of Moving Points
* Statement:
What is the maximum number of combinatorial changes
possible in a Euclidean Voronoi diagram of a set of $n$ points each moving
along a line at unit speed in two dimensions?
* Origin: Unknown (to JOR).  Perhaps Michael Atallah?
* Status/Conjectures: 
Long conjectured to be nearly quadratic. Solved now:
\cite{r-okdt-15}.
Natan Rubin proved an upper bound of $O(n^{2+\epsilon})$,
and a quadratic lower bound is known.
