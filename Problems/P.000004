* Number: 4
* Problem: Union of Fat Objects in 3D
* Statement:
What is the complexity of the union of ``fat'' objects
in $\R^3$?
* Origin: Uncertain, pending investigation.
* Status/Conjectures: Open. 
Conjectured to be nearly quadratic.
* Partial and Related Results:
The Minkowski sum of polyhedra of $n$ vertices
with the (Euclidean) unit ball
has complexity $O(n^{2+\e})$~\cite{as-pckum-99},
as does
the union of $n$ congruent cubes~\cite{pss-ucc3d-01}.
It is widely believed the same should hold true
for \emph{fat} objects, those with a bounded ratio of
circumradius to inradius, as it does in $\R^2$~\cite{es-cufop-00}.
