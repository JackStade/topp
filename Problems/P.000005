* Number: 5
* Problem: Euclidean Minimum Spanning Tree
* Statement:
Can the Euclidean
\emph{minimum spanning tree} (MST) of $n$ points in $\R^d$
be computed in time close to the lower bound of
$\Omega(n \log n)$ \cite{gkms-lbrad-96}?
* Origin: Uncertain, pending investigation.
* Status/Conjectures: Open.
* Partial and Related Results:
Several algorithms have been developed for general graphs with arbitrary
edge weights.
Chazelle presented an $O(m \alpha(m,n) \log \alpha(m,n))$-time algorithm
\cite{c-fdams-97},
and then an $O(m \alpha(m,n))$-time algorithm \cite{c-mstai-00},
where $\alpha(m,n)$ is the functional inverse of Ackermann's function,
and $n$ and $m$ are the number of vertices and edges respectively
in the graph.
Pettie and Ramachandran have since given an optimal algorithm for the graph
setting \cite{pr-omsta-02}, whose running time is an unknown function between
$\Omega(m)$ and $O(m \alpha(m,n))$.
In particular, when $m = \Omega(n \log n)$, $\alpha(m,n) = O(1)$ and
these time bounds are all linear in the number of edges, $m$.

But in the geometric setting, the graph is complete, so a time bound linear
in the number of edges, $m$, is quadratic in the number of points, $n$.
And indeed the best upper bounds for the Euclidean
MST approach quadratic for large $d$, e.g.,~\cite{ck-dmpsa-95}.
* Related Open Problems:
This problem is intimately related to the bichromatic closest
pair problem~\cite{aesw-emstb-91}.
