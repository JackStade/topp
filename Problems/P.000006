* Number: 6
* Problem: Minimum Euclidean Matching in 2D
* Statement:
What is the complexity of computing a minimum-cost
Euclidean matching for $2n$ points in the plane?
The \emph{cost} of a matching is the total length 
of the edges in the matching.
* Origin: Uncertain, pending investigation.
* Status/Conjectures: Open.
* Partial and Related Results:
An algorithm that achieves the minimum and runs
in nearly $O(n^{2.5})$ time has long been available~\cite{v-ghm-89}.
This was improved to $O(n^{1.5} \log^5 n)$ in~\cite{v-dcamc-98}.
Recently Arora showed how to achieve a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation
in $n (\log n)^{O(1/\epsilon)}$ time~\cite{a-ptase-98},
and this has been improved to 
$O((n/\epsilon^3) \log^6 n)$ time~\cite{va-aabnb-99}.

A special case of considerable interest is bipartite matching,
in which the points are red or blue and the matching connects
points of different color.
Here $O(n^{2+\epsilon})$ has been achieved~\cite{aes-vdsl3-99},
and a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation can be found in
$O((n/\epsilon)^{1.5} \log^5 n)$ time~\cite{va-aabnb-99}.
