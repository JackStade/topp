* Number: 7
* Problem: $k$-sets
* Statement:
What is the maximum number of $k$-sets? (Equivalently, what
is the maximum complexity of a $k$-level in an arrangement of
hyperplanes?)
* Origin: Uncertain, pending investigation.
* Status/Conjectures: Open.
* Partial and Related Results:
For a given set $P$ of $n$ points, $S\subset P$ is a {\em $k$-set}
if $|S|=k$ and $S=P\cap H$ for some open halfspace $H$.
Even for points in two dimensions the problem
remains open: The maximum number of $k$-sets as a function of $n$ and $k$
is known to be $O(n k^{1/3})$ by a recent advance of Dey~\cite{d-ibpks-98},
while the best lower bound
is only slightly superlinear~\cite{t-psmks-00}.
