* Number: 8
* Problem: Linear Programming: Strongly Polynomial?
* Statement:
Is linear programming strongly polynomial?
* Origin: Nimrod Megiddo~\cite{m-ibeap-82}\cite{m-tgpal-83}.
* Status/Conjectures: Open.
* Partial and Related Results:
It is known to be weakly polynomial, that is, polynomial in
the bit complexity of the input data~\cite{k-palp-80,k-nptal-84a}.
Subexponential time is achievable
via a randomized algorithm~\cite{msw-sblp-96}.
In any fixed dimension, linear programming can be solved
in strongly polynomial linear time
(linear in the input size),
established in dimensions 2 and 3 in~\cite{d-ltatt-84}
and for all dimensions in~\cite{m-lpltw-84}.
