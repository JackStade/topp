* Number: 10
* Problem: Simple Linear-Time Polygon Triangulation
* Statement:
Is there a deterministic, linear-time polygon triangulation
algorithm significantly simpler than that of Chazelle~\cite{c-tsplt-91a}?
* Origin: Implicit since Chazelle's 1990 linear-time algorithm.
* Status/Conjectures: Open.
* Partial and Related Results:
Simple randomized algorithms that are close to linear-time
are known~\cite{s-sfira-91},
and a recent randomized linear-time
algorithm~\cite{agr-lttsp-00} avoids much of the intricacies
of Chazelle's algorithm.
* Related Open Problems:
Relatedly, is there a simple linear-time algorithm for
computing a shortest path in a simple polygon, without
first applying a more complicated triangulation algorithm?
