* Number: 12
* Problem: Dynamic Planar Convex Hull
* Statement:
Can a planar convex hull be maintained to support
both dynamic updates and queries in logarithmic time?
More precisely, is there a data structure supporting insertions and deletions
of points and supporting various queries about the convex hull of the current
set of $n$ points, all in $O(\log n)$ time per operation?
An \emph{extreme-point query} asks to find the vertex of the convex hull
that is extreme in a given direction.
A \emph{tangent query} asks to determine whether a given point is interior to
the convex hull, and if not, to find the two tangent lines of the convex hull
that passes through the given point.
A \emph{gift-wrapping query} asks to find the two vertices of the convex hull
adjacent to a given vertex of the convex hull.
A \emph{line-stabbing query} asks to find the two edges of the convex hull
(if any) that intersect a given line.
(Note that two extreme-point queries suffice to determine whether a line
 intersects the convex hull, while a line-stabbing query determines where
 exactly the line intersects the convex hull if it does.)
* Origin: Uncertain, pending investigation.
* Status/Conjectures:
Solved (in a certain sense)
by Gerth Brodal and Riko Jacob in a FOCS 2002 paper \cite{bj-dpch-02}.
See also Jacob's PhD thesis \cite{j-dpch-02} for further details.
Their data structure supports
insertions and deletions in $O(\log n)$ amortized time
and supports extreme-point, tangent, and gift-wrapping queries
in $O(\log n)$ worst-case query bounds.
It remains open whether a logarithmic bound can be achieved in the worst case,
and whether logarithmic bounds can be achieved (amortized or worst case)
for line-stabbing queries.
* Partial and Related Results:
For 17 years, the authority on this problem was Overmars and van Leeuwen's
paper \cite{ol-mcp-81} which describes a data structure supporting insertions
and deletions in $O(\log^2 n)$ worst-case time and
all types of queries described above in $O(\log n)$ worst-case time.
Various structures achieve faster update times when either insertions or
deletions are not supported \cite{p-ortap-79, hs-asdch-92}.  But the
$O(\log^2 n)$ barrier remained until Chan's FOCS 1999 paper \cite{c-dpcho-99},
which improved the insertion and deletion time to $O(\log^{1+\epsilon} n)$
amortized for any $\epsilon > 0$.  The update time was further improved to
$O(\log n \log \log n)$ amortized by Brodal and Jacob \cite{bj-dpcho-00}
until the problem was finally solved in optimal $O(\log n)$ amortized time
by the same authors \cite{bj-dpch-02,j-dpch-02}.
Both the Chan and the Brodal and Jacob structures support
extreme-point, tangent, and gift-wrapping queries.
