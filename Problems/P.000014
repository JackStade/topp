* Number: 14
* Problem: Binary Space Partition Size
* Statement:
Is it possible to construct a \emph{binary space partition} (BSP)
for $n$ disjoint line segments in the plane of size
less than $\Theta(n \log n)$?  
* Origin: Paterson and Yao~\cite{py-ebsph-90}.
* Status/Conjectures: Solved by Csaba T\'{o}th~\cite{t-bppdl-09,t-bppdl-11}.
* Partial and Related Results:
The upper bound of $O(n\log n)$
was established by Paterson and Yao~\cite{py-ebsph-90}.
T\'{o}th~\cite{t-nbpp-01} improved the
trivial $\Omega(n)$
lower bound to
$\Omega(n\log n/\log\log n)$.  
Then in 2009 he established a matching upper bound~\cite{t-bppdl-09,t-bppdl-11}.
His proof is constructive and leads to a deterministic algorithm
that runs in $O(n \; \mathrm{polylog} \; n)$ time.
As his algorithm produces BSP trees whose height might be
linear in $n$, it remains open whether his complexity bound
can be achieved while achieving $O(\log n)$ height.
