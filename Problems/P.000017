* Number: 17
* Problem: Visibility Graph Recognition
* Statement:
Given a visibility graph $G$ and a Hamiltonian circuit $C$,
determine in polynomial time whether there is a simple polygon whose
vertex visibility graph is $G$, and whose boundary corresponds to $C$.
* Origin: ElGindy(?)
* Status/Conjectures: Open.
* Partial and Related Results:
The problem is not even known to be in NP~\cite{o-cgc18-93},
although it is
for ``pseudo-polygon'' visibility
graphs~\cite{os-vepvgcr-97}.
