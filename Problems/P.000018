* Number: 18
* Problem: Pushing Disks Together
* Statement:
When a collection of
disks are pushed closer together, so that no distance
between two center points increases, can the area of
their union increase?  
* Origin: Kneser (1955) and Poulsen (1954).
* Status/Conjectures:
Solved by K. Bezdek and R. Connelly.

* Partial and Related Results:
Previously only settled
in the continuous-motion case
\cite{bs-pdtcm-98}, for both this and
the corresponding question for intersection area decrease~\cite{c-aidp-96}.
But now both solved; see above.
