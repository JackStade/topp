* Number: 19
* Problem: Vertical Decompositions in $\R^d$
* Statement:
What is the complexity of the \emph{vertical decomposition}
of $n$ surfaces in $\R^d$, $d \ge 5$?
* Origin: Uncertain, pending investigation.
* Status/Conjectures: Open.
* Partial and Related Results:
The lower bound of $\Omega(n^d)$ was nearly
achieved up to $d=3$~\cite[p.~271]{as-dssga-00},
but a gap remained for $d \ge 4$.
A recent result~\cite{k-atubv-01}
covers $d=4$ and achieves $O(n^{2d-4+\epsilon})$ for general $d$,
leaving a gap for $d \ge 5$.
