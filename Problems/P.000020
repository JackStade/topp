* Number: 20
* Problem: Minimum Stabbing Spanning Tree
* Statement:
What is the complexity of computing
a spanning tree of a planar point set $P$ having minimum stabbing number?
The \emph{stabbing number} of a tree $T$ is the maximum number of
edges of $T$ intersected by a line.
* Origin: Uncertain, pending investigation.
* Status/Conjectures:
Solved, October 2003: the problem is NP-complete.
Significant advance on approximability in 2009.
* Partial and Related Results:
Fekete, L\"ubbecke, and Meijer \cite{flm-msnmt-04}
proved strong NP-completeness of minimizing the stabbing number or
axis-parallel stabbing number or crossing number or axis-parallel crossing
number in a perfect matching or spanning tree.
They also establish inapproximability by less than a 6/5 factor
of minimizing the axis-parallel stabbing number in a perfect matching.
They also prove strong NP-completeness of minimizing the axis-parallel
crossing number in a triangulation.

The complexity of minimizing the stabbing number or crossing number in
a triangulation remains open.
Furthermore, it remains open whether any of these problems have constant-factor
approximations.  See \cite{flm-msnmt-04} for some ideas.

In the worst case, any set of $n$ points in the plane has a
spanning tree of stabbing number 
$O(\sqrt n)$~\cite{a-rsoas-92,c-tbsns-88,w-ggssn-93}
and this bound is tight.
An $O(\sqrt n)$-approximation follows from this result.

There has been an advance on approximations~\cite{h-astlc-09}:
Har-Peled designed an algorithm that computes a spanning
tree of $n$ points $P$ in $\R^d$ whose crossing number
is $O(\min( t \log n, n^{1-1/d}))$, 
where $t$ the minimum crossing number of any spanning tree of $P$.
