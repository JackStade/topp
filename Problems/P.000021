* Number: 21
* Problem: Shortest Paths among Obstacles in 2D
* Statement:
Can shortest paths among $h$ obstacles in the plane,
with a total of $n$ vertices, be found in
optimal $O(n + h \log h)$ time using $O(n)$ space?
* Origin: Uncertain, pending investigation.
* Status/Conjectures: Open.
* Partial and Related Results:
The only algorithm that is linear in $n$ in time and space is
quadratic in $h$~\cite{kmm-eaesp-97};
$O(n\log n)$ time, using $O(n\log n)$ space,
is known~\cite{hs-oaesp-99}.
In three dimensions, the Euclidean shortest path problem among general
obstacles is NP-hard, but its complexity remains open
for some special cases, such as when the obstacles are disjoint unit
spheres or axis-aligned boxes; see \cite{m-gspno-00} for a survey.
