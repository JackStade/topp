* Number: 23
* Problem: Vertex $\pi$-Floodlights
* Statement:
How many $\pi$-floodlights
are always sufficient
to illuminate any polygon of $n$ vertices,
with at most one floodlight placed at each vertex?
An \emph{$\a$-floodlight} is a light of aperture $\a$.
(We consider here "inward-facing" floodlights, whose
defining halfspace lies inside the polygon, locally in the 
neighborhood of the vertex.  Other models of the problem
allow general orientations of floodlights or 
restricted orientations (e.g., "edge-aligned").)
* Origin: Jorge Urrutia, perhaps first published in~\cite{u-agip-00}.
* Status/Conjectures: Open.  Now known that the fraction of
$n$ that always suffices lies between $5/8$ and $2/3$.
* Partial and Related Results:
It was established in~\cite{eoux-ipvf-95} that
for any $\a < \pi$, there is a polygon that cannot be
illuminated with an $\a$-floodlight at each vertex.
When $\a=\pi$, $n-2$ lights (trivially) suffice.
So it is of interest
(as noted in~\cite{u-agip-00})
to learn whether a fraction of
$n$ lights suffice for $\pi$-floodlights.
A (very) special case is that $\lceil n/2 \rceil-1$
is a tight bound for "monotone mountains"~\cite{o-vplmm-97}.
T{\'o}th established~\cite{t-ipvpl-01} 
that (roughly)
$(3/4)n$ suffice, in the case of general orientation
floodlights (not necessarily inward-facing).
A lower bound of 
Santos,  that $\lfloor 3(n-1)/5\rfloor$ inward-facing floodlights 
are necessary (or $\lfloor 2(n-2)/5\rfloor$ generally oriented floodlights),
stood for several years, but
just recently (Jan.~2002) Urrutia constructed examples,
based on stitching together copies of Fig.~\ref{p5over8}, that show that
$5(k+1)/(8k+9)$ (inward-facing) floodlights are necessary for each $k$,
thus improving the lower bound factor from $0.6$ to $0.625$.
Also, Speckmann and T{\'o}th~\cite{st-vpgsp-01}
showed that $\lfloor n/2\rfloor$ vertex $\pi$-floodlights suffice
for general orientations, while $\lfloor (2n-c)/3\rfloor$ suffice
for inward-facing, edge-aligned orientations, 
where $c$ is the number of convex vertices.
In particular, this reduced the upper-bound fraction below $1$.
