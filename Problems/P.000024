* Number: 24
* Problem: Polygonal Curve Simplification
* Statement:
Can an $n$-vertex polygonal curve be simplified
in time nearly linear in $n$?
* Origin: Uncertain, pending investigation.
* Status/Conjectures: Open.
* Partial and Related Results:
The goal is to compute a simplification
that uses the fewest vertices of the original curve
while approximating it according to some prescribed error criterion.
Quadratic-time algorithms have been known for some time
\cite{cc-apcmn-96} and a recent algorithm achieves time
$O(n^{4/3+\e})$ for a certain error
criterion~\cite{av-eaapc-00}.  In practice, the Douglas-Peucker
algorithm is often used as a heuristic; it can be implemented to run in time
$O(n\log n)$~\cite{hs-oidpa-94}.
