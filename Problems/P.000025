* Number: 25
* Problem: Polyhedral Surface Approximation
* Statement:
How efficiently can one compute a polyhedral surface
that is an $\epsilon$-approximation of a given triangulated surface in
$\R^3$?
* Origin: Mitchell [?]
* Status/Conjectures: Open.
* Partial and Related Results:
It is NP-hard to obtain the minimum-facet surface
separating two nested convex polytopes~\cite{dg-ocop3-97a},
but
polynomial-time approximation algorithms are known
(\cite{bg-aoscf-95,ms-sapo-95,as-sagp-98})
for this case, and for separating two terrain surfaces,
achieving factors within $O(1)$ or $O(\log n)$ of optimal.
However, no polynomial-time approximation results
are known for general surfaces.
