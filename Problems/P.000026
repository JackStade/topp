* Problem: Surface Reconstruction
* Statement:
Given a sufficiently dense sample of
points on a surface (technically, an $\e$-sample),
reconstruct a surface homeomorphic to the original.
* Origin: Amenta and Bern [?]
* Status/Conjectures: Open.
* Partial and Related Results:
This has recently been accomplished for
smooth surfaces~\cite{acdl-sahsr-00},
but remains open for surfaces
with sharp edges and corners.

* Reward: <none>
