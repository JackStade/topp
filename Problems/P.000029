* Number: 29
* Problem: Hamiltonian Tetrahedralizations
* Statement:
Can every convex polytope in $\R^3$ be partitioned into tetrahedra
such that the dual graph has a Hamiltonian path?
* Origin: \cite{ahms-htfr-96}.
* Status/Conjectures: Open.
* Partial and Related Results:
Every convex polygon has such a \emph{Hamiltonian triangulation},
but not every nonconvex polygon does~\cite{ahms-htfr-96}.
The existence of a Hamiltonian path permits faster rendering
on a graphics screen via pipelining.

Chin, Ding, and Wang~\cite{cdw-htcp-05} have shown that examples
exist for which the {\em pulling} tetrahedralization of a convex polytope
is not Hamiltonian.  (A pulling tetrahedralization is obtained by joining
one vertex (the apex) to all other vertices of the polytope.)  It is open
if the shelling tetrahedralization may be always Hamiltonian.

Escalona et al.~\cite{efu-htsp-07} prove the conjecture up to $n=20$:
every points set of $n \le 20$ points admits a Hamiltonian Tetrahedralization.
They also detail an algorithm that finds a Hamiltonian Tetrahedralization
for $n$ points
by adding $O(n)$ Steiner points.  The algorithm runs in $O(n^{3/2})$ time.
