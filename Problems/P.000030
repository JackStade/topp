* Number: 30
* Problem: Thrackles
* Statement: 
What is the maximum number of edges in a thrackle?
A \emph{thrackle} is a planar drawing of a graph of $n$ vertices
by edges
which are smooth curves between vertices,
with the condition
that each pair of edges intersect at exactly one point, and have distinct
tangents there.
Another phrasing is that nonincident edges cross exactly once,
and no incident edges share an interior point.
* Origin: Conway, late 1960's.
* Status/Conjectures: Open.
Conway's conjecture is that the number edges cannot exceed $n$.
* Partial and Related Results:
The upper bound was lowered from $O(n^{3/2})$ to $2n-3$ in~\cite{lps-ctc-95},
and further lowered to $(3/2)(n-1)$ in~\cite{cn-bgt-00}.
The conjecture has long been known to be true for straight-line
thrackles.
The conjecture was extended in~\cite{cn-bgt-00}
to the claim that a thrackle on $n$ vertices embedded on a surface
of genus $g$ has at most $n + 2g$ edges.
See~\cite[Sec.~9.5]{bmp-rpdg-05} for a recent discussion and further references.
