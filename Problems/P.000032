* Problem: Bar-Magnet Polyhedra
* Statement:
Which polyhedra are bar-magnet polyhedra?
For reasons detailed below, 
the problem can be phrased as asking which 3-connected
planar graphs may have their edges directed so that the
directions ``alternate'' around each vertex.

Let $P$ be a polyhedron with a set of edges $E$.
For an edge $e \in E$, define a \emph{bar magnet}
as a mapping of $e$ to either $(N,S)$ or $(S,N)$,
which assigns the endpoints of $e$ opposite poles of
a magnet (and corresponds to directing the edge).  
Call a vertex $v$ of $P$ to be \emph{alternating}
under mappings of its edges to bar magnets if
the incident edges assigns alternating magnetic poles
to $v$ in the cyclic order of those edges
on the surface around $v$: $(N,S,N,S,...)$.  Thus if deg$(v)$ is even,
the poles alternate, and if deg$(v)$ is odd, at most two
like poles are adjacent in the circular sequence.
Finally, call a polyhedron a \emph{bar-magnet polyhedron}
if there is a bar-magnet assignment of each of its
edges so that each of its vertices is alternating.
* Origin: Joseph O'Rourke, 2001.
This problem is inspired by the toy ``Roger's Connection,''
which provides bar magnets and steel balls to construct
polyhedra.  The structures are most stable when each
vertex is alternating.
* Status/Conjectures: Settled by Bojan Mohar, Apr. 2004.
* Partial and Related Results:
At the presentation of the problem, Therese Biedl proved
that the polyhedron formed by gluing together two tetrahedra
with congruent bases is not a bar-magnet polyhedron:
alternation at the three degree-4 vertices of the common base
forces some other edge to be directed both ways.
Thus not all polyhedra are bar-magnet polyhedra.
Erik Demaine proved that a polyhedron all of whose vertices
have even degree is a bar-magnet polyhedron:
the graph has a face 2-coloring, and the edges of the
faces of color 1 can oriented counterclockwise,
which then orients each face of color 2 clockwise.
He also observed that if every vertex is of degree 3,
Petersen's theorem yields a perfect matching
that establishes such ``simple'' polyhedra are
bar-magnet polyhedra.

A clean characterization was provided by 
Bojan Mohar, who proved~\cite{m-bmpns-04}:
\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}
\begin{theorem}
Let $G$ be a planar graph embedded on the surface
of a sphere.  Define a new graph $R$ whose nodes are the 
vertices of odd degree in $G$, with two nodes of $R$ adjacent if they are 
cofacial in $G$ (lie on a common facial walk). Then $G$ has an $NS$-orientation
(i.e., is a bar-magnet polyhedral skeleton) 
if and only if $R$ has a perfect matching.
\end{theorem}
A \emph{facial walk} is a 
closed walk along the boundary of a face.
