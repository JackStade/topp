* Number: 34
* Problem: Extending Pseudosegment Arrangements by Subdivision
* Statement:
How many intersections among an arrangement of pseudosegments in the plane
must be added as vertices to allow the pseudosegment arrangment to be
extended to a pseudoline arrangement?

An \emph{arrangement of pseudosegments} in the plane is a family of
finite-length planar curves such that every two curves intersect in at
most one point.  An \emph{arrangement of pseudolines} in the plane is a family
of planar curves that extend to infinity on both ends such that every two
curves intersect in at most one point.  Only some pseudosegment arrangements
can be \emph{extended} to pseudoline arrangements.  However, if we allow
turning intersection points into vertices of the arrangement, thereby
subdividing the segments, then it is always possible to make a
pseudosegment arrangement extendible.  The question is how many such vertices
must be added in the worst-case in terms of the number $n$ of pseudosegments.
