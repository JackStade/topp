* Number: 35
* Problem: Freeze-Tag: Optimal Strategies for Awakening a Swarm of Robots
* Statement:
An optimization problem that naturally arises in the study of
``swarm robotics'' is to wake up a set of ``asleep'' robots, starting
 with only one ``awake'' robot.
One robot can only awaken another when they are in the same location.
As soon as a robot is awake, it may
assist in waking up other robots.  The goal is to compute an optimal
  {\em awakening schedule} such that all robots are awake by
  time $t^*$, for the smallest possible value of $t^*$ (the optimal
{\em makespan}).
The $n$ robots are initially at $n$ points of a metric space.
The problem is equivalent to finding a spanning tree with maximum out-degree
two that minimizes the radius from a fixed source.

Is it NP-hard to determine an optimal awakening schedule for robots in
the Euclidean (or $L_1$) plane?  In more general metric spaces, can
one obtain an approximation algorithm with better than $O(\log n)$
performance ratio?

* Origin: \cite{abfms-ftphwusr-01}
* Status/Conjectures:
\cite{abfms-ftphwusr-01} conjecture that the freeze-tag problem
is NP-hard in the
Euclidean (or $L_1$) plane.  (They show it to be NP-complete in
star metrics.)
* Motivation:
What is the most efficient way to "turn on" a large swarm of
robots or to distribute to them a secret or a token that 
requires close proximity in order to pass from one to another?
* Partial and Related Results:
There are a variety of related results
given in \cite{abfms-ftphwusr-01}.  They show that the problem is NP-hard
for "star metrics" (each asleep robot is at a leaf of a star graph whose
spokes have various lengths).  
For geometric instances ($L_p$ metrics) in fixed dimension,
they give an efficient PTAS.  For general metric spaces,
they give an $O(\log n)$-approximation algorithm.  They also
give improved approximation methods for other special cases (star
graphs, ultrametrics)
