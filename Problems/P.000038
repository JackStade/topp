* Number: 38
* Problem: Compatible Triangulations
* Statement:
Is it true that every two sets of $n$ planar points 
in general position with the
same number points on their convex hulls have
compatible triangulations?
Two triangulations are \emph{compatible} if they have the same
combinatorial structure, i.e., if their face lattices are
isomorphic.  For compatible triangulations $T_1$ and $T_2$
of point sets $S_1$ and $S_2$, there is a bijection
$\phi$ between the points such that $ijk$ 
is a triangle of $T_1$ empty of points of $S_1$ iff
$\phi(i) \phi(j) \phi(k)$
is a triangle of $T_2$ empty of points of $S_2$.
* Origin: \cite{aak-ctps-01} and~\cite{aahk-tct-02}.
* Status/Conjectures: Open.
Conjectured in \cite{aahk-tct-02} to be true.
* Motivation:
Morphing.
* Partial and Related Results:
The answer to the question posed is sometimes {\sc no}
for points not in general position.
If the bijection between the points is given and fixed, then
compatible triangulations do not always exist~\cite{s-jttm-87}.
When the bijection is not given, the conjecture is
proven only for point sets with at most three points interior
to the hull~\cite{aahk-tct-02}.
Compatible triangulations can always be achieved by the
addition of at most a linear number of Steiner points.
