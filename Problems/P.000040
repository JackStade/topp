* Number: 40
* Problem: The Number of Pointed Pseudotriangulations
* Statement:
For a planar point set $S$, is the number of pointed pseudotriangulations
always at least the number of triangulations?

A \emph{pseudotriangle} is a planar polygon with exactly
three convex vertices.  Each pair of convex vertices is connected
by a reflex chain, which may be just one segment.  
(Thus, a triangle is a pseudotriangle.)
A \emph{pseudotriangulation} of a set $S$ of $n$ points in the plane
is a partition of the convex hull of $S$ into pseudotriangles
using $S$ as a vertex set.
A minimum pseudotriangulation,
or \emph{pointed pseudotriangulation},
has the fewest possible number of
edges for a given set $S$ of points.

See~\cite{s-capnc-00, kkmsst-tdbpt-01, o-cgc43-02}
for examples, explanation of the term ``pointed,'' and further details.
* Origin: \cite{rrss-ctpw-01}.
* Status/Conjectures: Open.  Conjectured to be true,
with equality only when the points of $S$ are in convex position.
* Partial and Related Results:
The conjecture has been established for all sets of 
at most $10$ points: $\le 9$ by~\cite{bkps-ceptg-01},
and $10$ by Oswin Aichholzer [personal communication, 28 Mar. 2002].
Aichholzer et al.~\cite{aaks-cmp-02} establish that the number of pointed
pseudotriangulations on $n$ points is minimized when the points are in
convex position.
