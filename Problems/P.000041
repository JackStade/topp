* Number: 41
* Problem: Sorting $X+Y$ (Pairwise Sums)

* Statement:
Given two sets of numbers, each of size $n$, how quickly can the set
of all pairwise sums be sorted?  In symbols, given two sets $X$ and
$Y$, our goal is to sort the set $$X+Y = \{x+y \mid x \in X, y \in Y\}.$$

* Origin: 
The earliest known reference is Fredman \cite{f-hgiit-76}, who
attributes the problem to Elwyn Berlekamp.

* Status/Conjectures: Open.

* Motivation:
This is a simple special case of the more general question of
\emph{sorting with partial information}: How many comparisons are
required to sort if a partial order on the input set is already known?
Hern\'andez~Barrera \cite{b-foais-96} and Barequet and Har-Peled
\cite{bh-pctmh-01} describe several geometric problems that are
``Sorting-$(X+Y)$-hard''.  Specifically, there is a subquadratic-time
transformation from sorting $X+Y$ to each of the following problems:
computing the Minkowski sum of two orthogonal-convex polygons,
determining whether one monotone polygon can be translated to fit
inside another, determining whether one convex polygon can be rotated
to fit inside another, sorting the vertices of a line arrangement, or
sorting the interpoint distances between $n$ points in $\R^d$.
(Although Barequet and Har-Peled \cite{bh-pctmh-01} claim only that
the problems they consider are 3SUM-hard, their proofs immediately
imply this stronger result.)  Fredman also mentions an immediate
application to multiplying sparse polynomials \cite{f-hgiit-76}.

* Partial and Related Results:
The obvious $O(n^2 \log n)$-time algorithm is also the fastest known.
There are $\Omega(n^2)$ lower bounds for this problem in various
restrictions of the linear decision tree model of
computation~\cite{f-hgiit-76, d-lbss-89, e-lblsp-99}.  The main
problem is whether the logarithmic factor can be removed.

Fredman \cite{f-hgiit-76} proved that if a given partial order on $m$
elements has $L$ linear extensions, then the set can be sorted in at
most $\log_2 L + 2m$ comparisons.  For the sorting $X+Y$ problem, we
have $m = n^2$, the Hasse diagram of the partial order is an $n\times
n$ diagonal grid, and simple arguments about hyperplane arrangements
imply that $L = O(n^{8n})$.  Thus, Fredman's algorithm can sort $X+Y$
using only $8n\log n + 2n^2$ comparisons; unfortunately, the algorithm
needs exponential time to choose which comparisons to perform!  This
exponential overhead was reduced to polynomial time by Kahn and
Kim~\cite{kk-es-95} and then to $O(n^2\log n)$ by Lambert
\cite{l-ssxoc-92} and Steiger and Streinu \cite{ss-paslp-95}.  These
results imply that no superquadratic lower bound is possible in the full
linear decision tree model.

If the input consists of $n$ integers between $-M$ and $M$, an
algorithm of Seidel based on fast Fourier transforms runs in $O(n +
M\log M)$ time \cite{e-lblsp-99}.  The $\Omega(n^2)$ lower bounds
require exponentially large integers.

A closely related problem does have a subquadratic 
solution:
find a minimum element of $X+Y$, the so-called
\emph{min-convolution} problem,
posed by Jeff Erickson~\cite{do-op05-06}.
See~\cite{bcdehilt-ncxy-06} for the result and a discussion of connections
to the sorting problem.

* Related Open Problems:
The decision version of this problem---does the set $X+Y$ have $n^2$
unique elements?---is 3SUM-hard \cite{bh-pctmh-01};
see Problem \ref{Problem.11}.
