* Number: 42
* Problem: Vertex-Unfolding Polyhedra
* Statement:
Consider a polyhedron with simply connected facets (no holes on a facet)
and without boundary (every edge is incident to exactly two facets).
Can the polyhedron be cut along potentially all of its edges,
but leaving certain faces connected at vertices,
and unfolded into one piece in the plane without overlap?
Such an unfolding is called a \emph{vertex-unfolding},
to distinguish from widely studied
\emph{edge-unfoldings} (see Problem~\ref{Problem.9}) and
\emph{general unfoldings}.
An important subproblem here is whether all convex polyhedra have
vertex-unfoldings;
a negative answer would also resolve Problem \ref{Problem.9}.
* Origin: \cite{deeho-vusm-02}
* Status/Conjectures: Open.
* Motivation: <none>
* Partial and Related Results:
All simplicial polyhedra have vertex-unfoldings \cite{deeho-vusm-02}.
These vertex-unfoldings have a special structure called a ``facet path''
which does not exist in general, even for convex polyhedra
\cite{deeho-vusm-02}.
