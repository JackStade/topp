* Number: 43
* Problem: General Unfoldings of Nonconvex Polyhedra
* Statement:
Can every closed polyhedron 
%without boundary (every edge is incident to exactly two facets) 
be cut along its surface and unfolded into one piece in the plane
without overlap?
Such an unfolding is called a \emph{general unfolding}
to distinguish from \emph{edge-unfoldings} (see Problem~\ref{Problem.9}) and
\emph{vertex-unfoldings} (see Problem~\ref{Problem.42}).
* Origin: Perhaps~\cite{bdekms-upcf-03}.
* Status/Conjectures: Open.
* Motivation: <none>
* Partial and Related Results:
It is known that every convex polyhedron has a general unfolding.
In fact, there are three general methods for unfolding convex polyhedra:
the star unfolding~\cite{ao-nsu-91,aaos-supa-97},
the source unfolding~\cite{mmp-dgp-87},
and unfolding via quasigeodesics~\cite{iov-ucpq-07}.

On the nonconvex side, 
Bern et al.~\cite{bdekms-upcf-03} show a general unfolding for a 
nonconvex simplicial
polyhedron (whose faces are all triangles) that has no edge unfolding,
establishing that general unfoldings are more powerful than edge unfoldings.
(This was known earlier~\cite{bddloorw-uscop-98} but with an example
using nonconvex faces.)

It is now known that all orthogonal polyhedra 
(those with all edges
parallel to coordinate axes)
have a general unfolding~\cite{dfo-euop-07},
although the resulting single piece can be exponentially thin
and long.
See~\cite{o-uop-08} for a survey of progress on orthogonal polyhedra.
