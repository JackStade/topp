* Number: 44
* Problem: 3-Colorability of Arrangements of Great Circles
* Statement:
Is every zonohedron face $3$-colorable when viewed as a planar map?
An equivalent question, under a different guise, is the following:
is the arrangement graph of great circles on the sphere always
vertex $3$-colorable?
(The \emph{arrangement graph} has a vertex for each intersection point,
and an edge for each arc directly connecting two intersection points.)
Assume that no three circles meet at a point,
so that this arrangement graph is $4$-regular.
* Origin: The zonohedron-face version is due to Stan Wagon,
deriving from the work in~\cite{sw-rpt3c-00}.
The origin of the arrangement guise of the problem is~\cite{fhns-hcag-00}.
* Status/Conjectures: Open.
* Motivation: <none>
* Partial and Related Results:
Arrangement graphs of circles in the plane, or general circles on the sphere,
can require four colors~\cite{k-4c4vp-90}.
The key property in this problem is that the circles must be great.
All arrangement graphs of up to $11$ great circles have been verified
to be $3$-colorable by Oswin Aichholzer (August, 2002).
See~\cite{w-mrfch-02} for more details.
