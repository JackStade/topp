* Number: 45
* Problem: Smallest Universal Set of Points for Planar Graphs
* Statement:
How many points must be placed in the plane to support planar drawing of
all planar graphs on $n$ vertices?  More precisely, call a set of points
\emph{universal} if every planar graph on $n$ vertices can be drawn with
straight-line edges and without crossings by placing the vertices on a subset
of the points.  What is the smallest universal set of points as a function
of~$n$?  In particular, is it $O(n)$?
* Origin:
Attributed to Mohar by J\'anos Pach (23 Nov. 2002).
See also \cite{ck-lbsus-89} for some of the history.
%Rosenstiehl and Tarjan \cite{rt-rplbo-86} asked whether polynomial-size
%universal sets exist.
* Status/Conjectures: Open.
Between $\Theta(n)$ and $\Theta(n^2)$.
* Motivation: <none>
* Partial and Related Results:
By definition, a universal set of points must have size at least~$n$.
Chrobak and Karloff \cite{ck-lbsus-89} proved the stronger result that
any universal set of points must have at least $1.098n$ points.

On the other side, it is well-known that there are universal sets of
points of size $O(n^2)$.
In particular, every planar graph can be drawn on the
$O(n) \times O(n)$ square grid \cite{fpp-hdpgg-90, s-epgg-90}.
However, any universal set of points forming a grid
must have size at least $n/3 \times n/3$ \cite{ck-lbsus-89}.

Stephen Kobourov asks for the smallest value of $n$ for which a universal
point set of size $n$ does not exist.
He has checked by exhaustive search that there is a universal point set of size
$n$ for all $n \leq 14$.

It is now known that there is a universal set of $n$ points if
one bend per edge is permitted~\cite{ellw-usnpo-10}.
