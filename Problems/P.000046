* Number: 46
* Problem: 3D Minimum-Bend Orthogonal Graph Drawings
* Statement:
Does every simple graph with maximum vertex degree $\Delta \leq 6$
have a 3D orthogonal point-drawing with no more than two bends per edge?
A \emph{3D orthogonal point-drawing} of a graph maps each vertex to a unique
point of the 3D cubic lattice, and maps each edge to a lattice path between
the endpoints; these paths can only intersect at common endpoints.
In this problem, each path must have at most two bends, that is,
consist of at most three orthogonal line segments (links).
* Origin: Likely \cite{esw-tatdo-00}.
* Status/Conjectures: Open.
* Motivation: <none>
* Partial and Related Results:
Two bends would be best possible, because any drawing of $K_5$ uses
at least two bends on at least one edge.
If $\Delta \leq 5$, two bends per edge suffice \cite{w-3dogd-03}.
% above is also in \cite{w-a3dogd-98}
Two bends also suffice for the complete multipartite 6-regular graphs
$K_7$, $K_{2,2,2,2}$, $K_{3,3,3}$, and $K_{6,6}$
\cite{w-3dogd-00}.
In general, there is a drawing with an average number of bends per edge
of at most $2+\frac{2}{7}$ \cite{w-3dogd-03}.
% above has weaker result in \cite{w-a3dogd-98}
Additionally, three bends per edge always suffice,
even for multigraphs \cite{esw-tatdo-00, pt-aiogd-99, w-mnbv3d-01}.

Two-dimensional versions of this problem have also been studied.
A \emph{2D orthogonal point-drawing} of a graph maps each vertex
to a unique point of the 2D square lattice, and maps each edge to a lattice
path between the endpoints; the paths are allowed to intersect at common
endpoints and at proper crossings (points at which two paths meet but do
not bend), but must be edge-disjoint.
Every graph with maximum vertex degree $\Delta \leq 4$ has
a 2D orthogonal point-drawing with at most two bends per edge,
and furthermore within a $2 n \times 2 n$ rectangle of the grid
\cite{s-dgrg-95}.
On the other hand, as in 3D, any drawing of $K_5$ uses at least two bends
on at least one edge \cite{s-dgrg-95}, so two bends is again best possible.
For planar graphs, we can ask for 2D orthogonal point-drawings that
have no (proper) crossings.
In this case, again there are drawings with at most two bends per edge,
unless the graph has a connected component isomorphic to the icosohedron,
in which case three bends per edge is the best possible
\cite{bk-bhogd-98,lms-la2ep-98}.
