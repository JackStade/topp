* Number: 47
* Problem: Hinged Dissections
* Statement:
Does every pair of equal-area polygons have
a hinged dissection?
A \emph{dissection} of one polygon $A$ to another $B$ is a partition of $A$
into a finite number of pieces that may be reassembled to form $B$.
A \emph{hinged dissection} is a dissection where the pieces are hinged
at vertices and the reassembling is achieved by rotating the pieces
about their hinges in the plane of the polygons.
* Origin: \cite{ddeff-hdpp-03}, \cite[p.~3]{f-hdst-02}.
* Status/Conjectures:  Now settled: Hinged dissections exist~\cite{aacddk-hde-08}.  Update to this entry soon.
* Partial and Related Results:
There are two main partial results.
First, any two \emph{polyominoes} of the same area
have a hinged dissection~\cite{ddeff-hdpp-03}.
A polyomino is a polygon formed by joining unit squares at their
edges; see~\cite{k-p-97} and Problem~\ref{Problem.37}.
The polyomino result generalizes to hinged dissections
of all edge-to-corresponding-edge gluings
of congruent copies of any polygon.
Second, 
any asymmetric polygon has a hinged dissection 
to its mirror image~\cite{e-hkmd-01}.
Both of these results interpret the problem as
ignoring possible intersections between
the pieces as they hinge,
following what Frederickson calls the ``wobbly-hinged'' model.
This freedom may not be necessary, although this seems not to
be established in the literature.

Many specific examples of hinged dissections can be found in \cite{f-hdst-02}.
