* Number: 48
* Problem: Bounded-Degree Minimum Euclidean Spanning Tree
* Statement:
What is the complexity of finding a bounded-degree spanning tree 
for a planar point set, such that the total Euclidean 
length $\tau_k$ is as small as possible, subject to the constraint that 
no node has more than $k=4$ edges incident to it?
* Origin: 
Papadimitriou and Vazirani~\cite{pv-tgprt-84}
conjectured the problem to be NP-hard for $k=4$.
* Status/Conjectures: Solved: Proved NP-hard in~\cite{fh-ed4ms-09}.
* Motivation: Natural generalization of finding a shortest
geometric Hamiltonian path; arises in network optimization
* Partial and Related Results:
\cite{pv-tgprt-84} proved the problem to be NP-hard for $k=3$.
For $k\geq 5$, the problem is polynomially solvable, as
there always is a minimum spanning tree with no point having degree
more than 5.
* Related Open Problems: 
Various worst-case ratios of minimum weight bounded-degree spanning
trees for different degree bounds are still open, in particular
comparing $\tau_k$ to the weight $\tau$ of a minimum spanning tree.
\cite{fkkry-nftflwbdt-97} conjecture
$\tau_3/\tau \leq 1.103...$,
$\tau_4/\tau \leq 1.035...$ for Euclidean distances in the plane,
and $\tau_4/\tau \leq 1.25$ for Manhattan distances in the plane,
and give matching lower bounds.

\cite{kry-ldsts-96} show that for Euclidean distances,
$\tau_4/\tau \leq 1.25$ and $\tau_3/\tau \leq 1.5$ in the plane, 
and $\tau_3/\tau \leq 1.66...$ in arbitrary dimensions.

The first two of these bounds were improved to 
$\tau_4/\tau \leq 1.143$ and $\tau_3/\tau \leq 1.402$
by \cite{c-ebdstr-03}.

Now settled by NP-hard proof in~\cite{fh-ed4ms-09}.
