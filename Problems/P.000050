* Number: 50
* Problem: Pointed Spanning Trees in Triangulations
* Statement: Does every triangulation of a set of points in
the plane (in general position) contain a pointed spanning
tree as a subgraph? A vertex is pointed if one of its incident
faces has an angle larger than $\pi$ at this vertex. A spanning
tree is pointed if all of its vertices are pointed.
* Origin: Oswin Aichholzer, January 2003.
* Status/Conjectures: Settled negatively, January 2004.
* Partial and Related Results:
Obviously true if a triangulation contains a Hamiltonian path
or a pointed pseudotriangulation as a subgraph. For both
structures there exist triangulations not containing them.
(See, e.g., \cite{o-cgc43-02} for a discussion of pseudotriangulations.)
Settled negatively by Aichholzer et al.~\cite{ahk-twpst-04} with a
$124$-point counterexample.  A consequence is that there are
triangulations that require $\Omega(n)$ edge-flips to contain
a pointed spanning tree, or to become Hamiltonian.
