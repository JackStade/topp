* Number: 51
* Problem: Linear-Volume 3D Grid Drawings of Planar Graphs
* Statement:  Does every $n$-vertex planar graph have a 3D grid
drawing with $O(n)$ volume? A \emph{3D grid drawing} of a graph
is a placement of the vertices at distinct points with integer
coordinates such that the straight line segments representing
the edges are pairwise non-crossing. The volume is of the
bounding box.
* Origin: Felsner, Liotta, and Wismath \cite{flw-sdrg-02}.
* Status/Conjectures: Open.
* Partial and Related Results:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \cite{flw-sdrg-02}: Every $n$-vertex outerplanar graph has a 3D
      grid drawing with $O(n)$ volume.
\item \cite{dw-tpkt-03}: Every $n$-vertex graph with bounded treewidth
      has a 3D grid drawing with $O(n)$ volume.
\item \cite{dw-tdgd-03}: Every $n$-vertex planar graph has a 3D grid
      drawing with $O(n^{3/2})$ volume.
\item \cite{w-qltw-02}: Every $n$-vertex planar graph has an
      $O(1) \times O(1) \times O(n)$ grid drawing
      if and only if planar graphs have $O(1)$ queue-number.
      (See Problem~\ref{Problem.52} for a definition of queue-number.)
