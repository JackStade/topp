* Number: 52
* Problem: Queue-Number of Planar Graphs
* Statement: Does every planar graph have $O(1)$ queue-number? A
\emph{queue layout} of a graph consists of a linear order of the
vertices and a partition of the edges into non-nested \emph{queues}. 
Edge $xy$ is \emph{nested} inside edge $vw$ if
$v<x<y<w$ in the linear order. The \emph{queue-number} of a graph
$G$ is the minimum number of queues in a queue layout of $G$. This
question amounts to asking whether every planar graph has a
vertex ordering with a constant number of pairwise nested edges
(called a rainbow).

* Origin: Heath, Leighton, and Rosenberg~\cite{hlr-cqsm-92,hr-lgq-92}.
* Status/Conjectures: Open.
* Partial and Related Results:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \cite{hlr-cqsm-92,hr-lgq-92}: Every tree has queue-number $\leq1$.
\item \cite{hlr-cqsm-92,hr-lgq-92}: Every outerplanar graph has
      queue-number $\leq2$.
\item \cite{dw-tpkt-03}: Every graph with bounded treewidth has bounded
      queue-number.
\item \cite{w-qltw-02}: Planar graphs have $O(1)$ queue-number if and
      only if every $n$-vertex planar graph has a $O(1) \times O(1)
      \times O(n)$ grid drawing.
\item \cite{dw-nrgl-03}: Planar graphs have $O(1)$ queue-number if and
      only if Hamiltonian bipartite planar graphs have $O(1)$
      bipartite thickness. 
      The \emph{bipartite thickness} of a bipartite graph $G$ is the
      minimum $k$ such that $G$ can be drawn with the vertices on each
      side of the bipartition along a line, with the two lines parallel,
      and with each edge assigned to one of $k$ ``layers'' so that no two
      edges in the same layer cross (when drawn as straight line segments).
