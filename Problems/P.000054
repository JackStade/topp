* Number: 54
* Problem: Traveling Salesman Problem in Solid Grid Graphs
* Statement:
What is the complexity of finding a shortest tour in a solid
planar grid graph?
A \emph{planar grid graph} is a graph whose vertices are any set
of points on the planar integer lattice and whose edges connect every
pair of vertices at unit distance.
Distances between nodes correspond to induced shortest-path distances in the
graph, which corresponds to ``Manhattan'' distances.
A grid graph is \emph{solid} if it
does not have any holes, i.e., its complement in the planar integer lattice
is connected.
* Origin:
\cite{ips-hpgg-82} show that the problem is NP-complete in general
planar grid graphs. 
* Status/Conjectures: Open.
* Motivation: 
* Partial and Related Results:
\cite{ul-hcsgg-97} show that Hamiltonicity of a solid grid graph
can be decided in polynomial time.
Thus we can decide whether there is a tour of length equal to the
number of vertices.
In contrast, deciding Hamiltonicity is NP-hard in general planar grid graphs
\cite{ips-hpgg-82}.

\cite{abdfms-octtc-01} observe that finding the shortest tour
is polynomially solvable when restricted to \emph{thin} grid graphs,
i.e., grid graphs that do not contain an induced $2 \times 2$ square.
This problem asks about replacing the thin restriction with the
solid restriction.
