* Number: 55
* Problem: Pallet Loading
* Statement:
What is the complexity of the pallet loading problem?
Given two pairs of numbers, $(A,B)$ and $(a,b)$, and a number $n$, 
decide whether $n$ small rectangles of size $a \times b$,
in either axis-parallel orientation, 
can be packed into a large rectangle of size $A \times B$.
    
This problem is not even known to be in NP, because of the compact
input description, and the possibly complicated structure
of a packing, if there is one.

* Origin: Uncertain, pending investigation.
* Status/Conjectures: Open.
* Motivation: Natural packing problem; first-rate example of the relevance
of coding input and output.
* Partial and Related Results:
Tarnowsky~\cite{t-epasc-92} showed that the problem can 
be solved in time polynomial in the size of the input
if we are restricted to ``guillotine''
patterns, i.e., arrangements of items that can be obtained
by a recursive sequence of edge-to-edge cuts. This result uses
some nontrivial algebraic methods.

* Related Open Problems: 
What is the complexity of packing a maximal number of unit
squares in a simple polygon? (Problem \ref{Problem.54})

* Reward: <none>
* Appearances:
\cite{d-eaplp-87} claims the problem to be NP-hard;
\cite{e-hpbp-88} claims the problem to be in NP; but both claims are
erroneous. The precise nature of the difficulty is stated in
\cite{n-naplp-93}.
