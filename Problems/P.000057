* Number: 57
* Problem: Chromatic Number of the Plane
* Statement:
How many colors are needed to paint the plane so that no two points 
a unit distance apart are painted the same color? 
If the same question is asked of the line, the answer is $2$: 
Coloring $[0,1)$ red, $[1,2)$ blue, etc., 
ensures that no two unit-separated points have the same color.
One can view the question as asking for the
chromatic number $\chi(\mathbb{E}^2)$
of the infinite 
\emph{unit-distance graph} $G$,
with every point in the plane a vertex, and an edge between two vertices
if they are separated by a unit distance.  
* Origin: 
Hadwider and Edward Nelson, 1944.
* Status/Conjectures: Open.
Erd\H{o}s and de Bruijn showed~\cite{ed-cpigp-51} that
the chromatic number of the plane is attained for some finite subgraph of $G$.
This result led to narrowing the answer to %$4$, $5$, $6$, or $7$.
$4 \le \chi(\mathbb{E}^2) \le 7$.
For example, the lower bound of $4$ is established by the ``Moser graph.''

The knowledge gap for the
chromatic number of (3D) space is even wider than for the plane:
it is only known to 
satisfy $6 \le \chi(\mathbb{E}^3) \le 15$.
See~\cite{g-urt-04, g-Geo} for further results and references.

There is now some evidence that the chromatic number of the
plane may depend on the axioms of set theory.
This was first seen possible in examples constructed by 
Saharon Shelah and Alexander Soifer.  Now Payne~\cite{p-udgac-09}
has constructed unit-distance graphs with the same property.
