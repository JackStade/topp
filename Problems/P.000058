* Number: 58
* Problem:  Monochromatic Triangles
* Statement:
For any (planar) triangle $T$,
is there is a $3$-coloring of the (infinite)
plane with no monochromatic copy of $T$?
%Let $T$ be a triangle in the plane, with each point of the plane assigned
%a color.  
We imagine congruent copies of $T$ moved around the plane
via rigid motions, and seek a spot where $T$ is monochromatic.
$T$ is \emph{monochromatic} if its three vertices are painted the
same color, by virtue of lying on points of the plane painted that color.
Note that the coloring in the question may depend on the given triangle $T$.
* Origin: Ron Graham, MSRI, August 2003.
* Status/Conjectures: Open.
Ron Graham conjectures that the answer is \textsc{yes} for all triangles~$T$.
* Motivation: 
The question of the chromatic number of the Euclidean
plane $\mathbb{E}^2$ has been unresolved for over fifty years
(Problem~\ref{Problem.57}).
This problem is an interesting, much more restricted variant, posed
by Ron Graham as part of his ``Geometric Ramsey Theory"''
investigation~\cite{g-urt-04}~\cite{g-Geo} at his 
\htmladdnormallinkfoot{MSRI lectures}{http://www.msri.org/publications/video/index07.html}
in August 2003.
