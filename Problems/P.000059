* Number: 59
* Problem: Most Circular Partition of a Square
* Statement:
What is the optimal partition of a square into convex pieces
such that the circularity of the pieces is optimized?
The \emph{circularity} of a polygon is the ratio 
of the radius of its smallest circumscribing circle to the radius
of its largest inscribed circle.  Thus circular pieces have
circularity near $1$, and noncircular pieces have circularity greater
than $1$.  An optimal partition minimizes the maximum ratio over all
pieces in the partition.
* Origin: \cite{do-prpcp1-03}
* Status/Conjectures: Open.
* Motivation: This is a type of ``fat'' partition.
* Partial and Related Results:
It is known from~\cite{do-prpcp1-03} that the equilateral triangle
requires an infinite number of pieces to achieve the optimal
circularity of $1.5$, and that for
all regular $k$-gons, for $k \ge 5$, 
the one-piece partition is optimal.
The square is a difficult intermediate case.
It is known that the optimal ratio lies in the
narrow interval
$[1.28868, 1.29950]$.
The upper bound is established by the $92$-piece partition shown
in Figure~\ref{stainedglass}.

It is conjectured in~\cite{do-prpcp1-03} that, as with the
equilateral triangle case, no finite partition achieves the
optimal ratio, but rather optimality can be approached as
closely as desired as the number of pieces goes to infinity.
