* Number: 60
* Problem: Transforming Polygons via Vertex-Centroid Moves
* Statement: 
Given an arbitrary polygon, transform it by a finite sequence of
``vertex-centroid'' moves to a regular polygon.
A \emph{vertex-centroid move} is a translation of
a vertex $v$ along the line $vm$, where $m$ is the
centroid of the vertices of the polygon, i.e.,
$1/n$-th of the sum of the vertex coordinates.
Vertices may move only one at a time, but in any
order and any number of times.
* Origin: Steve Gray, 2003.
* Status/Conjectures: Open.
* Partial and Related Results:
Let $v(t)$ and $m(t)$ be the positions of
the moving vertex and centroid as a function of time $t$,
where $t$ runs from $0$ to $1$ during the vertex translation.
Let $L$ be the line containing $v(0) m(0)$.
As $v(t)$ moves on $L$, $m(t)$ remains on $L$.

For $n=3$, a triangle can be made equilateral in two moves.
Already for $n=4$ the situation is less clear.

One could set many other transformational goals besides
achieving regularity:  scale the polygon by $s > 0$,
rotate the polygon, etc.
The notion generalizes to arbitrary dimensions.

A more difficult variant would be to use the area centroid
rather than the vertex centroid, in which case $m(t)$ does
not remain on $L$, so that a vertex move would have the flavor
of pursuit of a moving target.
