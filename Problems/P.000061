* Number: 61
* Problem: Lines Tangent to Four Unit Balls
* Statement:
Given a set of $n$ unit-radius balls in
$\R^3$, 
what is the number of
lines that are tangent to four of the balls in the set,
and miss all the others?
(The balls are not necessarily disjoint.)
* Origin: \cite{aaks-laub3-05}.
* Status/Conjectures: Open, conjectured to be $\Omega(n^3)$.
* Motivation: 
The number of lines tangent to four unit balls dominates
the combinatorial complexity of the space of lines
that avoid all the balls. 
And this complexity is related to questions in visibility
and in optimization.
* Partial and Related Results:
In~\cite{aaks-laub3-05} it is established that
the number is $O(n^{3 + \epsilon})$ for any $\epsilon > 0$.
The best lower bound is $\Omega(n^2)$, which can be achieved,
for example, as follows.

Place $n/4$ balls separated along a horizontal line $L_1$,
and another $n/4$ along a parallel line $L_2$ below,
with each of the lower balls directly
below an upper ball with their centers $1$ unit apart.
Thus each pair of balls overlap, their surfaces intersecting
in a circle.
Arrange a second set of $n/4$ pairs of intersecting balls
along lines $L_3$ and $L_4$, far from $L_1/L_2$
and with all four lines parallel, and such
that all circles of sphere intersections are coplanar.
Now it is easy to see that a line tangent to two circles of
intersection, one from the $L_1/L_2$ group, one from the
$L_3/L_4$ group, is tangent to four balls.
And there are $\Omega(n^2)$ such lines.
(The same bound can be achieved with disjoint balls with a similar
arrangement, but the analysis is slight more complex.)

The problem is also interesting if all balls are
disjoint; it is not clear if disjointness affects the
answer asymptotically.
