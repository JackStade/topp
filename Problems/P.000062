* Number: 62
* Problem: Volume Maximizing Convex Shape
* Statement:
Let $C$ be a convex piece of paper; its
boundary may be a smooth curve, or a polygon.
A \emph{perimeter halving folding} is a folding of $C$ obtained by 
identifying two points $x$ and $y$ on the boundary of $C$ that halve
the perimeter, and then folding $C$ by ``gluing'' $xy$ to $yx$.
This always results in a unique convex shape in 3D, a polyhedron if
$C$ is a convex polygon~\cite{do-gfalop-07}.
What unit-area shape $C$ achieves the maximum volume 
possible via a perimeter-halving
folding?
* Origin: Posed by
Joseph Malkevitch in 2002, in a slightly different form:
for polygons, and not restricting the folding to perimeter-halving.
The modifications above were suggested at CCCG'05~\cite{do-op05-06}.
The restriction to perimeter halving eliminates some more complex foldings
possible for some convex polygons, and so in that sense simplifies
the problem.
The extension to smooth shapes is a natural generalization.
Smooth shapes only admit perimeter-halving foldings.
* Status/Conjectures: Open.
* Motivation: <none>
* Partial and Related Results:
Even fixing the shape and finding the maximum volume perimeter
halving for that shape is difficult.
For a circular disk, all perimeter halvings lead to a flat doubly-covered
half disk, all of volume zero.
The only other shape for which
the answer is known, and then only empirically,
is the case of $C$ a square~\cite{ado-cpfs-03}. 
The resulting polyhedron of $6$ vertices and $8$ faces, shown in
Fig.~\ref{max.vol},
achieves about 60\% of the volume of
a unit-area sphere.
