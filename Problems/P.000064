* Number: 64
* Problem: Edge-Unfolding Polycubes 
* Statement:
Is there any genus-zero orthogonal polyhedron $P$ built
by gluing together cubes face-to-face that cannot be
edge-unfolded, where all cube edges on the surface of $P$
are considered edges available for cutting?
These orthogonal polyhedra are sometimes known as \emph{polycubes},
3D versions of 2D \emph{polyominoes}.
* Origin: George Hart and Joseph O'Rourke, 2004.
* Status/Conjectures: Open.
* Motivation: More general problems seem even more difficult.
* Partial and Related Results:
This is a special case of a more general problem, which is equally
open.
The goal, as in Problem~\ref{Problem.9}, is to cut the surface
and unfold without overlap.
An \emph{edge unfolding} only permits cutting along edges of the
polyhedron.
A \emph{grid unfolding}
adds extra edges to the surface by intersecting
the polyhedron with planes parallel to coordinate planes
through every vertex, and so is easier to edge-unfold.
Easier still is the posed problem:  The orthogonal polyhedron
is built from cubes, and all cube edges are available for cutting.
Is there any such polyhedron that cannot be edge-unfolded?
Such an example would narrow the options, but it may be that
every orthogonal polyhedron can be grid-unfolded.
(An easy box-on-box example~\cite{bddloorw-uscop-98} shows
that without some surface refinement~\cite{do-op04-05}, 
not all orthogonal polyhedra
can be edge-unfolded.)
The posed question is among the most specific whose answer would
make progress.

Only a few narrow subclasses of orthogonal polyhedra 
are known to have grid-unfolding algorithms:  
orthotubes, orthostacks of orthogonally convex slabs,
and orthogonal terrains.
See~\cite{o-uop-08}.
