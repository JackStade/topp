* Number: 68
* Problem: Rolling a Die over a Labeled Board
* Statement:
Label the faces of a unit cube with numbers $1$--$6$ as in a die.
%(There are actually two standard labelings, with all opposite pairs of face
% labels summing to~$7$; pick one.)
Place the cube to sit on an integer lattice grid,
with one corner at the origin and sides aligned with the axes.
Completely label every lattice square of a rectangular ``board'' $R$,
whose corner is at the origin,
with numbers in
$\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$.
The problem is to roll the cube over its edges so that,
for each square $s \in B$ labeled $l$,
the cube lands on $s$ precisely once, and when it does so,
the top face of the cube has label~$l$.

What is the computational complexity of solving an instance of this problem?

* Origin: Version posed by O'Rourke at the
2005 \emph{Canadian Conference on Computational Geometry}~\cite{do-op05-06},
and subsequently substantially developed and embellished in~\cite{bbddefkst-orcp-07}.
* Status/Conjectures: Open.
* Motivation:
This problem was inspired by van Deventer's
``Rolling block mazes''~\cite{vD-rbm-04}.
The paper~\cite{bbddefkst-orcp-07} uncovered a rich history to rolling
cube puzzles going back to the 1960's, which will not be repeated here.
* Partial and Related Results:
The original posed problem labeled an arbitrary connected
set $S$ of squares, rather than a rectangular board $R$;
the cells outside of $S$ are \emph{free}, and may be visited
any number of times with any number on the die top.
That former problem is solved in~\cite{bbddefkst-orcp-07},
which establishes that, as conjectured, the problem is NP-complete.

The posed problem has no free cells, and in fact the labels are
all in a rectangular board $R$.  This seems the most interesting
specific variant, for it is left possible in~\cite{bbddefkst-orcp-07}
that, if there is a solution for $R$, it is ``uniquely rollable.''
They establish that there are boards with labeled and
\emph{blocked} (i.e., forbidden) cells for which rollable
Hamiltonian cycles are not unique, but they leave open fully labeled boards.
The uniquely-rollable conjecture is settled for all boards
with side lengths at most 8.
