* Problem: Yao-Yao Graph a Spanner?
* Statement:
Is the Yao-Yao Graph
a $t$-spanner for constant $t$?
A geometric graph is a \emph{$t$-spanner}
(or just a \emph{spanner}) if, for every pair of nodes, %$u$ and $v$, 
the shortest distance between the nodes following
the edges of the graph is at most $t$ times the Euclidean distance
between them.
See below for the definition of the Yao-Yao graph.
* Origin: \cite{wl-dsbdw-02}(?)
* Status/Conjectures: Open.
* Partial and Related Results:
The Yao graph $Y_k$~\cite{y-cmstk-82} is defined as follows. At each node $u$,
any $k$ equally-separated rays originated at $u$ define $k$ cones. In
each cone, choose the shortest edge $uv$ among all edges from $u$,
if there are any, and add a directed edge $\overrightarrow{uv}$ to $Y_k$.
It is known that for the undirected $Y_k$, $k=4, k \ge 6$, $Y_k$ a $t$-spanner
(e.g., see~\cite{bddossw-pi2ay-10}).
%for $t = 1/[1-2\sin(\pi/k)]$.
%JOR: This t value no longer holds for all the cases, just the k>6 cases.
The Yao-Yao graph $YY_k$~\cite{wl-dsbdw-02} starts
with the directed Yao graph, and reduces the maximum degree
of nodes as follows.
At each node $u$, all \emph{incoming} edges from each cone are discarded, 
except for the shortest one $\overrightarrow{vu}$. 
And now the result is treated as an undirected graph.
Many properties of
$YY_k$ have been established, but whether
or not $YY_k$ is a $t$-spanner remains open.
