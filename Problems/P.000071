* Number: 71
* Problem: Stretch-Factor for Points in Convex Position
* Statement:
For points $S$ in convex position
(i.e., every point is on the hull of~$S$),
is the Delaunay triangulation of $S$ a
$(\pi/2)$-spanner?
A geometric graph is a \emph{$t$-spanner}
(or just a \emph{spanner}) if, for every pair of nodes, %$u$ and $v$, 
the shortest distance between the nodes following
the edges of the graph is at most $t$ times the Euclidean distance
between them.
The constant $t$ is the \emph{stretch factor} or \emph{dilation}.

* Status/Conjectures: Now closed: false.  [This entry awaiting updating.]
* Partial and Related Results:
Chew conjectured that the Delaunay triangulation
is a $t$-spanner~\cite{c-tapga-89} for some constant~$t$.
Dobkin et al.~\cite{dfs-dgaag-90} established this
for $t = \pi (1+\sqrt{5})/2 \approx 5.08$.
The value of $t$ was improved to $2 \pi / (3 \cos (\pi/6)) \approx 2.42$
by Keil and Gutwin~\cite{kg-cgwac-92},
and further strengthened in~\cite{bm-ort-04}.
Chew showed that $t$ is $\pi/2 \approx 1.57$ for points on
a circle, providing a lower bound.
``It is widely believed that, for every set of points
in $\R^2$, the Delaunay triangulation is a 
$(\pi/2)$-spanner''~\cite[p.~470]{ns-gsn-07}.

This history suggests the special case posed above.

There is a new forthcoming result:~\cite{ckx-oddtp-09}.
