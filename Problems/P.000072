* Number: 72
* Problem: Polyhedron with Regular Pentagon Faces
* Statement:
Let $M$ be a closed polyhedral 
surface homeomorphic to $S^2$ 
which is entirely composed of equal regular pentagons. 
If $M$ is immersed in 3-space, 
is it necessarily the boundary of a union of solid 
dodecahedra that are glued together at common facets?
* Origin: Richard Kenyon, first posed in 2006.
* Status/Conjectures: Open.
* Partial and Related Results:
The corresponding question for equal squares has a positive answer.
The question for surfaces embedded in 3-space is also interesting
and open.
The Kepler-Poinsot great dodecahedron has regular pentagon
faces, and is immersed, but is not
homeomorphic to $S^2$ ($V-E+F=-6$).
