* Number: 73
* Problem: Congruent Partitions of Polygons
* Statement:
Partition a given polygon $P$ into $n$ mutually congruent pieces
so that the area of $P$ not covered by the union of the pieces is as small
as possible.
A partition which leaves out the least area is an \emph{optimal} congruent partition
for that $n$. 
If a congruent partition is a perfect cover, leaving no area uncovered,
then it is called a \emph{perfect congruent partition}.
%If the optimal congruent partition is not unique,
%it would be useful to find one in which the pieces have the fewest number of edges. 
Two polygons are \emph{congruent} if one can be made to 
coincide with the other by translation, rotation, or reflection (flipping over).
%(Sometimes this is called \emph{mirror-congruence}.)

* Motivation: <none>
* Partial and Related Results:

A new introduction to the problem is now available: \cite{n-cppsi-10}.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
It is known that there exist quadrilaterals with no perfect congruent partition
for any $n$:
\url{http://domino.research.ibm.com/Comm/wwwr_ponder.nsf/challenges/December2003.html}.
%It is unknown if the same holds true in 3D.

%\item 
%An approximation for $n=2$ is offered in~\cite{n-cmcpc-10}.

%\item
%It seems likely, although not certain, that if $P$ is convex, 
%the simplest piece that gives an optimal congruent partition for some $n$ need not be convex.

%\item
%If, instead of a set of $n$ mutually congruent pieces, we only seek a partition into 
%$n$ mutually identical \emph{sets of pieces} (with each set required to have some finite number of pieces), it can be seen that for $n=2$ or any power of 2, \emph{any} polygon can be partitioned \emph{with no left over} into $n$ mutually identical sets of triangles. For other values of $n$, even such partitioning into identical sets of polygons may not be in general possible.

%* Further questions:

\item
Deciding 
whether $P$ has a perfect congruent partition
appears little explored for $n>2$.
The case of $n=2$ is solved in~\cite{efir-pptmc-08}
with an $O(n^3)$ algorithm.

\item
If congruence is 
restricted to translation and rotation only, to what extent
does the problem change?

\item
Can the left-over area be upper-bounded as a function of $P$ and $n$?
An attempt 
for $n=2$ is offered in~\cite{n-cmcpc-10}.
