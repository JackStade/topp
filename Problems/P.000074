* Number: 74
* Problem: Slicing Axes-Parallel Rectangles
* Statement: 
Let us say that two rectangles in the place are
independent if both their $x$- and $y$-axis projections are disjoint.  A
set of rectangles is then independent if the rectangles are pairwise
independent.  Suppose that a collection of axes-parallel rectangles
contains no independent set of size $m$ or greater.  What is the minimal
number, $f(m)$, of horizontal and vertical lines needed to slice every
rectangle in the collection?
* Origin: Vincent Vatter, Jun 2009.
* Status/Conjectures: 
It was known that $f(m)$ exists and is at most exponential.
An advance was made
in 2010 by
Werner and Lenz, 
who established a quadratic upper bound, $O(m^2)$,
in~\cite{wl-pbrsn-10}.
They also uncovered a long history of the problem under
other names, e.g., ``$d$-separated interval piercing.''
In fact, the result was already established by Tardos and Karolyi
earlier.  See the cited paper for more details.

But, as pointed out by Pablo Sober\'on,
apparently an earlier result~\cite[Thm.~1.4]{k-tdi-97},
established $f(m) \le 2 m$.
This largely solves the problem.

* Motivation: <none>
* Partial and Related Results: The problem arises in the study of
permutation classes, see~\cite{v-spc-08}, where
it was proved that $f(m)$ exists and is at most exponential.
