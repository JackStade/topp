* Number: 75
* Problem: Edge-Coloring Geometric Graphs
* Statement:
For a set of $n$ points in the plane in general position,
draw a straight segment between every pair of points.
What is the minimum number of colors that
suffice to color the edges such that no two edges that
cross have the same color?
(With the general position assumption, all crossings are
proper crossings.)
* Origin: Ferran Hurtado: \cite{adhnu-ocnsg-05}.
* Status/Conjectures: Open.
* Partial and Related Results:
Each color class determines a plane subgraph of the complete graph.
Because one can arrange for $n/2$ pairwise crossing edges,
$n/2$ is a lower bound.
The best upper bound is in~\cite{bhrw-pcggp-06}:
$n - \sqrt{n/12}$.
It has been conjectured that $(1-\epsilon) n$ is an upper
bound for some $\epsilon > 0$.
%Is this David's conjecture, or Ferran's?
