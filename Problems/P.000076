* Number: 76
* Problem: Equiprojective Polyhedra
* Statement:
Identify or construct all $k$-equiprojective polyhedra.
A polyhedron $P$ is \emph{$k$-equiprojective} if its orthogonal
projection to a plane is a $k$-gon in every direction not parallel
to a face of $P$.
Thus a cube is 6-equiprojective.

\cite{s-tpcp2-68}.
* Status/Conjectures: Open.
* Motivation: <none>
* Partial and Related Results:
A characterization is detailed in~\cite{hl-ep-08}:
``A polyhedron is equiprojective iff its set of edge-face pairs
can be partitioned into compensating pairs.''
For term definitions, see the original paper.
Building on this work, a recent paper
\cite{hhlnqr-snep-10}
establishes that any equiprojective polyhedron has at least
one pair of parallel faces,
that there is no 3- or 4-equiprojective polyhedron,
and the triangular prism is the only 5-equiprojective polyhedron.
