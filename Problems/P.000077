* Number: 77
* Problem: Zipper Unfoldings of Convex Polyhedra
* Statement:
Does every convex polyhedron $P$ have a zipper unfolding?
A \emph{zipper unfolding} cuts open $P$ via a single
path, necessarily a Hamiltonian path (to span all vertices), 
and unfolds the surface to a non-overlapping polygon in the plane.
The segments of the path need not lie along edges of $P$.
* Origin: Posed as Open Problem 2 in~\cite{lddss-zupc-10}, which
introduced the term "zipper unfolding."
* Status/Conjectures: Open.
* Partial and Related Results:
With the restriction that the cuts follow edges,
any $P$ without a Hamiltonian path in its 1-skeleton
has no zipper edge-unfolding, e.g., a rhombic dodecahedron.
(Such polyhedra have been studied, e.g., in~\cite{b-spcp-61}.)
