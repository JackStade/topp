* Problem: Rectangling a Rectangle

* Statement: 
Do there exist rectangles that may be partitioned into a finite number $n$ of rectangular pieces of equal area but with all perimeters different?
 
* Origin: 
Posed by R. Nandakumar, Feb. 2012:
\url{http://nandacumar.blogspot.in/2012/02/packing-rectangles.html}. 
The phrase ``rectangling a rectangle'' was introduced by Michael
Brand at
\url{http://brand.site.co.il/riddles/201203q.html}.

* Status: 
A partial solution for rectangular pieces with real edge lengths
is known---a spiral layout of 7 rectangular pieces forming 
a larger rectangle.  See Brand's web site.
The question remains open for tiling rectangles with rational edge lengths. 

* Conjecture: If all edge lengths of the pieces are required to be
rational, no such partition is possible
(R. Nandakumar and N. Ramana Rao).

* Further questions: 

The question may be extended to higher dimensions $d$ in the obvious way.
The posers believe there is no solution in $\mathbb{R}^d$
for $d \ge 3$.
