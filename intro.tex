\subsection{Introduction}
This project originally aimed to record important open problems
of interest to researchers in computational geometry and
related fields.  It commenced in 2001 with the publication of
thirty problems in Computational Geometry Column~42~\cite{mo-cgc42-01}
(see \htmlref{Problems 1--30}{problems by number}),
and then grew to over 75 problems.

While we are no longer encouraging new problem submissions, we strongly
encourage updates to existing problems, especially when those problems have
been solved (completely or partially).
Updates should be done in the form of a Github Pull Request;
see the \htmladdnormallink{Github repository}{https://github.com/edemaine/topp}.

Each problem is assigned a unique number for citation purposes.
Problem numbers also indicate the order in which the problems were entered.
Each problem is classified as belonging to one or more categories.

The problems are also available as a single
%\htmladdnormallink{Postscript}{master.ps}
%or 
\htmladdnormallink{PDF}{master.pdf}
file.

you may select from a category of interest below,
or view
