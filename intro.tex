\subsection{Introduction}
This is the beginning of a project\footnote{
Partially supported by NSF grants to the three editors.} 
to record open problems
of interest to researchers in computational geometry and
related fields.  It commenced with the publication of
thirty problems in Computational Geometry Column~42~\cite{mo-cgc42-01}
(see \htmlref{Problems 1--30}{problems by number}),
but has grown much beyond that.
We encourage correspondence to improve the entries; please send email to
\htmladdnormallink{orourke@cs.smith.edu}{mailto:orourke@cs.smith.edu}.
If you would like to submit a new problem, please fill out
\htmladdnormallink{this template}{problem.template}.

Each problem is assigned a unique number for citation purposes.
Problem numbers also indicate the order in which the problems were entered.
Each problem is classified as belonging to one or more categories.

The problems are also available as a single
%\htmladdnormallink{Postscript}{master.ps}
%or 
\htmladdnormallink{PDF}{master.pdf}
file.

To begin navigating through the open problems,
you may select from a category of interest below,
or view
\hyperref{a list of all problems sorted numerically}
          {Section }
          { for a list of all problems sorted numerically}
          {problems by number}.
